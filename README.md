<h1>ROS 2 Workshop Instructions</h1>

## 1) Introduction

Considering the push within the Cerberus project to use ROS 2, it was decided that a workshop would be productive to introduce NREC personnel to the world of ROS programming and its conventions.

As such, this workshop aims to showcase some functionalities of ROS 2, while also illustrating some of the best practices associated with it at a level that is more advanced than what is generally covered in the typical ROS tutorials found online. It also particularly highlights some of the key parts of the ROS stack on Cerberus. 

## 2) Structure

This workshop is planned to be implemented like a typical "lab" at a college course, with a ROS-knowledgeable instructor guiding a small cohort of students while they complete the tasks themselves. Since ROS is a very hands-on skill, this is probably more productive for knowledge acquisition than pure lectures. With that said, an intro lecture to the general ROS philosophy can be provided if needed. 

The structure of the workshop is conceptualized as follows:

- Day 0: ROS 2 lecture (if needed, depending on cohort's level of skill)
- Day 1: Programming a node with topics, services and parameters, together with RQT and CLI tools. ROS Conventions.
- Day 2: Using external libraries inside a ROS node. ROS bags. Launch files.
- Day 3: Use of common external packages and how they typically integrate with ROS. Development of a ROS simulation.
- Day 4: Cerberus-specific package study.

## 3) Prerequisites

- Intermediate level of C++ (which will be the language mostly used) and Python needed, especially in the context of OOP. Students should understand classes, inheritance, threading, pointers, etc.
- A linux machine running Ubuntu 22 and with ROS 2 Humble installed
- TODO: ADD MORE?

**Note on docker**: the use of a docker could remove the necessity of a Ubuntu 22 machine. While that is true, the addition of a docker would add complexity to that is essentially a ROS **tutorial**, meaning we might spend more time fighting docker than ROS itself to get things working. Furthermore, even though ROS 2 is theoretically multi-platform, please stick to linux if you plan to develop code for it...

**Note on version**: ROS 2 Humble was chosen as it is the distro used on Cerberus. This tutorial should be pretty interchangeable with other ROS 2 distros that came after Humble though.

## 4) Installation 

Follow the installation instructions on this [link](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) to install ROS 2 Humble on your machine. The desired package suite is the **Desktop Install**. DonÂ´t forget to also install the ```ros-dev-tools```.

You should add the ROS sourcing to your ```.bashrc``` folder to ensure every new terminal sets up the correct ROS environment (this is called an "underlay"):

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Also set your ROS configuration to only find nodes in your local machine. This prevents nodes from interfering across multiple machines in the same network:

```bash
echo "export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, install the full suite of RQT tools:

```bash
sudo apt install '~nros-humble-rqt*'
```

If you with to test if your installation is running successful, try executing these examples in separate terminals

```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

```bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```
